        <h1>About Potatos</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>The History of Potatos</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Potatos were domesticated over 7,000 years ago by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Inca Empire</span>. They were used for eating, relgious ceremonies, and a measurement of time (how much time it took to cook).</p>
        <p>Potatos were taken to Europe by <span style="font-weight:bold;">Spanish Conquistadors</span> in the 15th century. Initially, people were scared of potatos because they looked like a similar poisonous plant.</p>
        <p>However, because potatos could grow in bad soil conditions and their high calorie content, these fears were overcome, and potatos soon became an important part of the diet of many europeans.</p>
        <p>The reliance on potatos is exemplified in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Irish Potato Famine (1845-49)</span>, when a disease destroyed almost all of the potatos in Ireland.</p>
        <p>In 6 years, 1 million people (about 13 percent of the population before) died directly because of the lack of potatos.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Potato Farming Today</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Potatos in Washington are usually planted in the months of Febuary-May.</p>
        <p>Potatos today are grown with "seed potatos" (special potatos with "eyes" that can grow the plants) in fields of around 100 acres.</p>
        <p>These seed potatos are loaded into a specialized potato planter towed by a tractor.</p>
        <p>These potatos are watered by a sprinkler system that moves in a circle around a point, known as a center pivot:</p>

        <br>
        <p>To minimize diseases, potato farmers usually use a potato plot every 4 years, giving viruses time to die out before replanting.</p>
        <p>After the potatos have grown, farmers usually "kill" their fields by stopping the water supply 10 days before harvest.</p>
        <p>Killing the fields makes the potatos grow a thicker skin, allowing them to be harvested without damage.</p>
        <p>Lastly, a specialized potato harvester harvests the potatos, seperating out rocks and other forign materials.</p>
        <p>These potatos are either immediately sold or stored in specialized storage buildings for up to 11 months.</p>
